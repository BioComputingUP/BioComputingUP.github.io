# DisProt webinars available in ELIXIR TeSS

## [An introduction to DisProt][elixir-intro-disprot] (beginner level)

At the end of this course users will be able to:
* Explain what DisProt is and how to use it
* Explain how to navigate the DisProt database
* Explain and describe the home page features (e.g. datasets, blog, Twitter)
* Discuss and interpret the DisProt entries
* Identify where to find the DisProt Documentation
* List the various pages and content available in the documentation: Biocuration, Help and About

## [Exploring structural and functional annotations of IDPs with DisProt][exp-disprot] (intermediate level)

At the end of this course users will be able to:
* Explain what are the key features of a DisProt entry: discuss the DisProt feature viewer; explain and describe structural and functional annotations
* Explain how to perform complex searches in DisProt: identify and describe protein functions; describe and analyze thematic datasets
* Explain how to download the output of a search in DisProt


# DisProt protocol in Current Protocols in Bioinformatics

## [Exploring Manually Curated Annotations of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins with DisProt ][prot-disprot]

Updated protocol, open access, featuring three basic protocols and two support protocols:
* Basic Protocol 1: Performing a search in DisProt
* Support Protocol 1: Downloading options
* Support Protocol 2: Programmatic access with DisProt REST API
* Basic Protocol 2: Exploring the DisProt Ontology page
* Basic Protocol 3: Visualizing and interpreting DisProt entriesâ€“the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein use case
