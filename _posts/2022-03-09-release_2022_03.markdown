We completed the Gene Ontology (GO) integration, started in September 2021 (see previous [blog post][post]). 
All the GO terms are now available for annotation in DisProt and we transmit GAF-format compliant annotations to Gene Ontology.
To know more about this, please have a look at our [Ontology page][ontologyPage].
