# New thematic dataset of intrinsic disorder in autophagy-related proteins

The DisProt <i>“autophagy-related proteins”</i> focuses on the IDRs and IDPs involved in selective macroautophagy and on the LIR motifs - localized inside these IDRs - that have been experimentally tested for their ability to bind Atg8 homologs in autophagy. Information about the LIR motifs have been annotated based on [LIRcentral][LIRcentral], manually curated resource of experimentally confirmed LIR motifs from literature hosted in the [laboratory][BRL-lab] of Prof. Vasilis Promponas. The <i>“autophagy-related proteins”</i> thematic dataset was indeed created thanks to the collaboration with [Prof. Vasilis Promponas][vasilis-promponas-linkedin] and LIRcentral biocurator, [Vasileios Sagris][vasileios-sagris-linkedin].

Examples from the <i>“autophagy-related proteins”</i> dataset include:
* the Autophagy-related protein 3 (Atg3) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DisProt:[DP02826][DP02826], LIRcentral:[P40344][P40344]). Atg3 is characterized by three IDRs, one of them including the canonical LIR motif "WEDL" involved in the interaction of Atg3 with Atg8.
* the Serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (STK3) of Homo sapiens (DisProt:[DP01461][DP01461], LIRcentral:[Q13188][Q13188]). STK3 is characterized by the presence of one IDR, spanning residues 314-427, that includes the non canonical LIR motif “MVI” involved in the interaction with LC3C and GABARAP.

The <i>“autophagy-related proteins”</i>, currently including 100 protein entries, can be accessed from the Datasets section in the DisProt home page and [here][Autophagy].

# New thematic dataset of intrinsic disorder in cancer-related proteins

The DisProt <i>“cancer-related proteins”</i> focuses on the intrinsically disordered regions found in proteins involved in cancer. The “cancer-related proteins'' thematic dataset was created thanks to the collaboration with [Prof. Zsuzsanna Dosztanyi][zsuzsanna-linkedin] and [Dr. Matyas Pajkos][pajkos-linkedin]. Proteins included in our dataset have been selected using [COSMIC][COSMIC] and relevant literature to explore the role of intrinsic disorder in the context of cancer progression and somatic mutations driving cancer.

Examples from the <i>“cancer-related proteins”</i> dataset include:
* the Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) from Homo sapiens (DisProt:[DP00238][DP00238]), whose 1500-residue long central region (100 - 1649) is intrinsically disordered.
* the Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) from Homo sapiens (DisProt:[DP00018][DP00018]), a fully disordered protein.
* the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor (VHL) from Homo sapiens (DisProt:[DP00287][DP00287]), including an intrinsically disordered N-terminal tail spanning residues 1-53. Residues 54-213 of the protein are instead characterized by a molten globule conformation under native conditions. 

The <i>“cancer-related proteins”</i>, currently including more than 140 protein entries, can be accessed from the Datasets section in the DisProt home page and [here][Cancer].
