Thanks to this collaboration we are now able to rely on Gene Ontology terms for our annotations in [DisProt][DisProt-linkontologies], along with actively contributing new terms - specific to the IDP field - to [Gene Ontology][GO-link].

We are thankful to Pascale Gaudet and the GO team for all the support provided, and we hope you find this collaboration useful and a chance to improve the two resources.
