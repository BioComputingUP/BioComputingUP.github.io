DisProt is now using two specific ontologies to improve the interoperability and the consistency of our manually curated annotations. We adopted the [Gene Ontology (GO)][pub-2] to annotate functions and interactions, and the [Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO)][pub-2] to annotate the techniques used to assess the disorder.
We invite you to explore our [About page][about-link] to get familiar with the ontologies in DisProt.
