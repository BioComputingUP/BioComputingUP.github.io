# **DisProt 2025_06 - New thematic dataset of Bacterial virulence-related proteins**

*Written in July 2025 by Maria Cristina Aspromonte*

With the latest thematic dataset released by DisProt, we turn our attention to a fascinating and still emerging topic: the role of **intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)** and **intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)** in **bacterial pathogenicity**.

This curated collection highlights disordered bacterial proteins with functional roles in **virulence, host–pathogen interaction**, and **immune evasion**. While IDPs are well recognized in eukaryotic systems, their relevance in bacteria is still under active investigation.

From this dataset, we have **76 bacterial proteins**, all annotated in DisProt, revealing compelling insights into the biological significance of structural disorder in bacterial infections.


### **How much disorder is there?**

**Total number of proteins:** 76 \
**Minimum disorder content**: 1.15% \
**Maximum disorder content**: 75.19%

### **Examples of disordered virulence proteins in bacteria**


**Cholera enterotoxin subunit A**



* **DisProt ID**: [DP00250](https://www.disprot.org/DP00250)
* **Organism**: *Vibrio cholerae* serotype O1
* **Disorder content**: 75.19%
* **Function**: This subunit plays a central role in the activity of the cholera toxin. It undergoes a **disorder-to-order transition** (IDPO:00050) upon binding, which facilitates its **activation and intracellular trafficking**, including **internalization** and **retrograde transport to the endoplasmic reticulum** — essential steps for the toxin’s cytotoxic effect.


**Translocated intimin receptor (Tir)**

* **DisProt ID**: [DP04161](https://disprot.org/DP04161)
* **Organism**: *Escherichia coli*
* **Disorder content**: 50.73%
* **Function**: Tir is directly translocated into the host cell via a Type III secretion system. Its intrinsically disordered regions provide the **flexibility needed to interact with multiple host targets**, modulate host signaling pathways, and manipulate immune responses.

Thanks to the effort of our expert DisProt biocurators, **[Maria Victoria Nugnes](https://apicuron.org/curators/0000-0001-8399-7907), [Federica Quaglia](https://apicuron.org/curators/0000-0002-0341-4888)**, and the *DisProt Consortium*, the new dataset features more than **300** pieces of evidence obtained from **102** publications.
