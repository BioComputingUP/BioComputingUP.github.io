# eLearning course for DisProt biocurators

A course on literature curation of IDPs is now available from the [ELIXIR Slovenia eLearning platform][elearning]. The course covers different topics such as basic information on IDPs, literature curation, use of the annotation interface and database privacy policy. 

Prospective DisProt biocurators can express their interest in attending the DisProt curation course by filling out the [registration form][registration], and choose if attending the course in [English][english-registration] or in [Spanish][spanish-registration].

# Submission form for DisProt external users

An interactive annotation form has been made available to external users to contribute new annotations. The form is compliant with the *“MIADE metadata guidelines: Minimum Information About a Disorder Experiment”* ([https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.12.495092][miade-paper]) for the annotation of IDP experimental data.  

The form allows users to specify the UniProt identifier of the protein they are annotating, along with optional information such as Name, email address, ORCID identifier and Comments. The interactive form includes three sections. In the first section users are required to add a PubMed identifier of the protein under annotation, an Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) term corresponding to the experimental technique used to characterize the IDP/IDR in the publication, the start and end residues of the IDR (Boundaries) as described in the publication. In the second section, users can select the evidence aspect of the IDR - structural state (IDPO), structural transition (IDPO), function (GO) and function (IDPO) - as well as cross references and statements from the publication that describe the annotated IDR. Finally, the third and last section allows the users to add MIADE annotations by selecting one (or more) additional fields among sequence construct, experimental conditions and experimental components.
