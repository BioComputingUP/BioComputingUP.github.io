# Release featuring a thematic dataset of NDDs-related proteins

Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) include early-onset conditions such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit. To construct the dataset, we selected proteins involved in NDDs, using [SFARI], [SysNDD] and [DBD] databases to fill the gap and explore the role of IDPs/IDRs. Our dataset includes various examples of proteins associated with NDDs ranging from histone proteins (e.g. Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, [DP03446]), to transcription factors (e.g. Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 1, [DP03451]; Transcriptional repressor protein YY1, [DP02595]) and ion channels (e.g. Sodium channel protein type 2 subunit alpha, [DP03178]; Sodium channel protein type 9 subunit alpha, [DP03805]).

Thanks to the effort of DisProt biocurators the new dataset features 312 proteins and more than 1213 pieces of evidence obtained from over 494 publications.

Examples from “NDDs-related proteins” dataset: 

* Synaptic functional regulator FMR1 - [DP00134] is encoded by FMR1 gene, which is responsible for the most common form of Intellectual disability and Autism spectrum disorders (Fragile X syndrome). Experimental studies have highlighted the important role of their IDRs in the phase separation process and condensate formation.
* Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 - [DP00539] has a crucial role in neuronal development. MeCP2 is mostly unstructured protein and can adopt transitory secondary structures when binding to other molecules. 

## Overlap of “Cancer” and “NDDs” related proteins

In this new dataset, 39 entries with a key role in neurodevelopmental disorders have been reported to be important in cancer pathology. Among these, for example, we can mention the Androgen Receptor protein ([DP00492]) or the Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein ([DP00238]).

The DisProt team is grateful to the main NDDs-related proteins curators Emanuela Leonardi, Fatemeh Kordevani and Mariane Goncalves Kulik for their remarkable work and effort in the construction of this thematic dataset.
