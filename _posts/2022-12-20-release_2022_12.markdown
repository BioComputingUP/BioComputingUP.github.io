# New thematic dataset of intrinsic disorder in Neglected tropical diseases proteins

The neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a subset of infectious diseases that are mainly prevalent in tropical areas, where they mostly affect impoverished communities. The variety of pathogens responsible for NTDs is represented in our dataset.

Examples from the <i>“Neglected tropical diseases proteins”</i> dataset include: 
* viruses e.g. <i>Rabies virus</i> Phosphoprotein, [DP03566][DP03566]; <i>Dengue virus</i> Non structural protein 5, [DP03809][DP03809]
* bacteria e.g. <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> Translocated actin-recruiting phosphoprotein, [DP01472][DP01472]
* protozoa e.g. <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> SBDS-like protein, [DP00957][DP00957]; <i>Leishmania donovani</i> HASPA protein, [DP03871][DP03871]
* fungi e.g. <i>Madurella mycetomatis</i> Pea pathogenicity protein 2, [DP03786][DP03786]
* helminths e.g. <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> MEG-14, [DP01970][DP01970]; <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> Serine protease inhibitor, [DP03791][DP03791]

The Neglected tropical diseases proteins dataset release features 82 entries and more than 125 pieces of evidence, annotated from more than 100 new articles not present in DisProt yet. We are grateful to our biocurators Julian Bergier, Jaime Santos Suárez, Edoardo Salladini, Juliet Nilsson, Pedro Pereira and Galo Balatti for their remarkable commitment and effort.
